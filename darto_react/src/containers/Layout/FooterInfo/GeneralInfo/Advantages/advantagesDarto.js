            <li>Improves Hand/Eye Coordination</li>
            <p class='about_Parra '>
              Darts is all about accurate throwing and the more you play the
              better you will become at throwing your darts into the area you
              are aiming for. This is a sign of your hand/eye coordination
              improving, which is vital to every other aspect of life, from
              playing other sports to simply picking up objects.
            </p>
            <li>Brain Exercise </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Darts is an ideal mental game because you have to do a lot of
              calculations in your head all the time. It also helps you to
              increase your capability of memorizing. If you are a darts player,
              you should also have the ability to think quickly. The most common
              form of darts games involves playing down from a score of 501 to
              0, finishing on a double. When playing this game, you must add up
              the score from your set of three darts and subtract it from the
              total. As you get within a finish, you need to work out the
              numbers you must hit, to make the exact score. It’s a great
              workout for the brain and it keeps it active.

            <li> Release Aggression </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              When you are angry or fed up with something, you can release that
              aggression by throwing some darts to the dartboard. It will feel
              like throwing some object to a hardboard. It looks funny, but it
              works.
            </p>
            <li>Stress Relief </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Playing darts can reduce your stress, and that's why you can see
              dartboards in most of the recreational rooms, offices, pubs, and
              bars. When you are under high pressure, you can relieve your
              stress by throwing some darts at the dartboard. Many people find
              these helpful, and that's why now in modern offices you can see
              dartboards. Many students also use these as medicine the night
              before the exam. It can take a lot of focus and concentration to
              play darts, as it not only requires accurate throwing, you must
              think about what it is you require to score, whether you are
              playing 501 or games like darts cricket. This takes your mind off
              other things you may have to go on in your life and helps you to
              relax as a positive diversion.

            <li>Social Skills</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              While practicing darts at home can be done alone, to play any form
              of game, means getting together with other people. Playing darts
              is a great way to socialize with friends and if you get a team
              together in a league, it can be a great way to meet new people
              too.
            </p>
            <li>Improves your Sense of Concentration </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Playing darts requires a great deal of concentration. Whether it
              be working out a score or thinking about the area of the board you
              want your darts to land and getting into position to throw it,
              being able to concentrate 100% and avoid distraction is key.
            </p>
            <li>Increases Confidence </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Winning a game of darts can increase the confidence in people,
              which is great. However, it is not acting’s taking part that can
              also increase confidence in those who may be quite introverted.
              Playing darts involves stepping up, in-front of other people and
              performing an action, which can also lead to a general increase in
              confidence.
            </p>
            <li>Physical Self Control </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Throwing a dart accurately requires good control of the body. If
              you are unable to keep your arm, body, and head in control when
              throwing a dart, it will most likely be off-target. Ask someone to
              watch you throw and check if you are out of control in any way. If
              you are, can work on it and improve your physical self-control. It
              looks incredible when the dart players can hit the number they
              wanted. But how do they hit so preciously? It looks tough but not
              impossible. Dart players do a lot of practice to become that level
              of expert. They do hours of hours training to take full control of
              their body. A dart player needs physical self-control because only
              then they could hit their accurate number. Usually, a dart player
              takes control of their shoulder, arm, head, and legs before
              releasing their dart. So a dart player should have more physical
              self-control than an ordinary person.
            </p>
            <li>Teamwork </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              When playing in a darts match in an official league or playing a
              tournament with friends, you are always interacting with other
              people and this can increase teamwork skills. Therefore,
              organizing a darts tournament at work can be a great way to get
              colleagues working together.
            </p>
            <li> Improves Logical and Strategic Thinking </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Darts often require a lot of thought and part of that process is
              strategic thinking. The most common darts games involve tactical
              play, whether it be trying to leave a specific number to hit next
              time or leaving an opponent with a difficult shot. In general,
              every game tries to improve your strategic thinking, but in darts,
              it goes to another level. In darts, you have to decide which
              number to choose and when to strike (you can hit now or later, but
              if later, why then?). Here you also have to think logically and
              have to play tactically in many games. So naturally, darts players
              can do more critical thinking than ordinary people. It usually
              helps a lot for young people. It helps them to become more logical
              from the beginning.
            </p>
            <li>Exercise </li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              It may seem like darts is a game for the pub but darts players can
              get a lot of exercises you play darts for an hour, your arm is
              doing a great deal of work and you need to walk to the dartboard
              and back, each time you throw to collect your darts. If you are
              playing a few times per week, this exercise soon adds up.
            </p>
            <li>Increase mental Agility:</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              {" "}
              Darts require lots of Counting and Quick Thinking
            </p>

            <li> Throwing Darts Improves Your Math Skills</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              You can increase your math skills by simply playing 501 because,
              in this game, you have to subtract your points from a total of 501
              points. Every time you score some points, you reduce them from
              your total points. But it only applies if the ou has a traditional
              dartboard because if you have an electronic dartboard, you don’t
              have to count by yourself. It will count points for you. That’s
              why now most people like to buy electronic dartboards because it
              is automated and does most of the work for you. It is a practical
              way to increase your kid’s math skills because it is a natural
              way. So, you can have a dartboard at your home so that sometimes
              you can exercise your math skills.
            </p>
            <li> Improves Mood</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Remember, we talked about making new friends and being social for
              playing darts. It is also applicable here. Because when you have
              some lovely friends and you people spend quality time together,
              that improves your mood. You become happier, and you become more
              active because of the new social life. So darts can make an impact
              on your mood.
            </p>

            <li>Improve Immune System</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Because it improves your mood and reduces your stress, it can also
              enhance your immune system. When you feel happy most of the time,
              your immune system gets a boost. So playing darts can make an
              impact on your immune system indirectly.
            </p>

            <li>It Gives You Quality Time with Your Family</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Now in this modern age, our families become less and less
              interactive because of social media and online games. Darts allow
              us to get together and enjoy the moments by playing darts. It can
              be a beautiful family game. It increases the interaction and
              communication between family members.
            </p>

            <li>A Way to Spend Some Time Outdoors</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              A dartboard will also give you some opportunity to spend some
              quality time with your family and friends outside. Most people
              think it is the only indoor game. But it's not true. I mean, it's
              true, but you can also play darts outside of your home. We know
              many people who carry their dartboard to their campsite so that
              they can play it on their camping trip. Some people also like to
              play darts in their backyard-today you want, you can spend some
              beautiful moments with your family and friends by playing darts
              outside.
            </p>

            <li> Keeps You Active</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              Darts can make you active in your day-to-day life. A recent study
              shows that the people involved with any sports are more productive
              than the people who are not involved with any games. You can
              attach yourself to any sports to become more active in real life.
              But because darts is an indoor game and it takes less physical
              activity, it applies more here.
            </p>
            <li>Utilizes Nonverbal Skills</li>
            <p class='about_Parra'>
              When you are in a very high competitive match, you need to
              communicate with your teammate with non-verbal communication,
              because if you talk, your opponent might understand your next
              move. So darts force us to improve our nonverbal communication
              skills.
