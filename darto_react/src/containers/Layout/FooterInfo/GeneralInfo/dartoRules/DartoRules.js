                Sports. There are general rules of play which apply to all three
                disciplines of darts sports, and specific rules which apply only
                to one or two of the three disciplines. The regulations refer to
                particular aspects of the organization of the sporting
                activities, such as leagues, competitions and tournaments.

                The Competition Rules, the Anti-Doping Code and the Disciplinary
                Council Code, as amended from time to time, are integral parts
                of the Constitution. The Rules and Disciplinary Council must
                co-ordinate with the Tournament Director to institute ranking
                systems which can be used universally to categories players. It
                is envisaged that these ranking systems will involve recording
                “Points Per Dart” or “PPD” and “Marks Per Round or “MPR” for 01
                and “Cricket” based games respectively, over periods of time, in

                aimed towards the face of the dartboard. If a dart is not thrown

              <p>
                2.2. Each match or leg shall be played with a double finish,
                i.e. to finish, and win, the player must land a dart in the
                double (Double Ring or Bull) of the number equal to one half of

                scores more points than remain in the leg or match, or the same
                points as remain without finishing on a double, or leaves a
                score of one, then that throw shall not count and the score
                shall remain as it was prior to that throw.

                When a Bull Throw is taken in any match in the DARTO World Cup
                the following must be observed: Darts, which land outside of the
                ‘25’ sector, must be left in the board. If a player requests
                that a dart, which is outside the ‘25’ sector, be straightened,
                this is allowed - the player must request that the dart be
                straightened. The Marker should place their finger underneath
                the dart that is to be straightened. They should then take the
                dart out of the board and replace it in exactly the same place,
                horizontal and straight. The dart should not be pulled or drawn
                down, as it will not be left in the correct place, i.e. where
                the point of the dart enters the board.
