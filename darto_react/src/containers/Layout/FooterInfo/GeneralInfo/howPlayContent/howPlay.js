              To play 501 darts the rules are simple, both players or teams
              start with a score of 501 points. Each player then takes
              alternating turns throwing their 3 darts at the dartboard. The
              points scored are removed from the total, and then the opposing
              player/team does the same. The last dart thrown must land in a
              double ring. The first to reach zero wins the game.

              Players can use any darts as long as the overall length of
              30.5cms. (12") not weigh more than 50 grams is exceeded. The dart
              should consist of a needle-shaped point, which shall be fixed to a
              barrel. At the rear of the barrel shall be an attached flight
              shaft/stem, which may consist of up to five separate pieces. (IE:
              a flight, a flight securing device(s), a flight protector, and a
              stem.) For soft tip darts used on soft tip boards, most rules
              state that no dart heavier than 18 grams can be used otherwise the
              board can be damaged. Some soft tip boards can take heavier darts
              up to 24 grams but with heavier darts, you do tend to break more
              tips.

              The order of play is either determined by a toss of a coin or by
              each player throwing for the center bull, the nearest being the
              player that throws first. The rules here can vary depending on the
              league you may be playing in; the local rules should be observed
              at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
              When throwing for the bull, if the first thrower hits the center
              bull or outer bull the dart is usually removed before the second
              player throws. If the second player hits the same as the first
              player, then the bulling-up procedure starts again. If the first
              player's dart does not hit either the center bull or outer bull,
              then the dart remains on the board until the second player throws.
              If the first player's dart is obstructing the bull the second
              player may request the marker/ref to straighten the dart. (See
              local rules)
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the order of play has been determined the winner will start
              leg one and odd legs after that. The loser will start leg two and
              even legs thereafter.
            </p>
            <p>
              A throw consists of 3 darts except where the game is finished in
              less.
            </p>
            <p>
              Darts cannot be re-thrown this includes darts that miss the board
              and darts that bounce off the board wiring system. Only darts that
              have their points touching the scoring area of the board score.
            </p>
            <p>
              A player may be told, if he asks, what number they scored, or what
              number he requires for the game, by the score announcer, but not
              how to get it.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the number required for the game is exceeded in the course of a
              throw, the throw ceases, and no account is taken of the score
              obtained during that throw.
            </p>

              Generally, each player’s score must start and finish a game with a
              double (The outer narrow ring of the board). Competition games,
              however, are usually played with a straight start (no compulsory
              double) but with a compulsory double to finish.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first throw is deducted from the player's start number e.g.
              501 and then from the subsequently reduced total. The scorer
              should show both the score obtained for the throw and the reducing
              total remaining.
            </p>
            <p>
              For fast Practice, games play501. For league and competition 501.
              Any agreed starting number can be used but usually, the number
              should end 01 the reason for this is that a player must hit
              another part of the board other than the 20’s segment in order to
              win a game.

              The Board should hang securely from a wall so that the height of
              the center bull is 5'8" or 1.73m from the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The throwing distances can vary from anything from 7ft to 8'6" but
              the standard game is played from 7'9 ¼" 2.37m from the face of the
              board measured horizontally. For soft tip boards, the throwing
              distance is usually longer i.e. 8’ or 2.43m
            </p>
            <p>
              The toe-line or Oche shall be marked and should be at least 18"
              long. The toe line can be just a painted line on the ground or a
              securely raised line indicator such as a piece of wood or metal.
              The latter is preferable as the thrower as the firm edge to rest
              his/her foot against.
